Run `python3 game.py` to start the game.

The game is based on a word game designed by mewtru called [wordflow](https://mewtru.com/wordflow)

The game is simple.

You have a list of 12 letters and 60 seconds to spell as many words as you can.
As you spell the words, you earn points, but more importantly, you earn extra seconds. 

At the end of the game, your points and the number of words you entered will be displayed on the screen.

The challenge is to beat your own personal best!

Run `python3 gameClass.py` to start the game using a class/object based method.
